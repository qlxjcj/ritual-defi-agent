"""wash_infra_detector.py — v0.7.7 wash infrastructure detection.

Pure on-chain signature (no Arkham label dependency). Identifies the
three-address pattern of a wash-trading infrastructure setup:

  X (Taker / executor)
    │
    ├─ atomic-pair tx: each tx contains BOTH X→user AND user→X
    │
    ├─ P (Maker buy-side): X consistently receives `from` P > 80% of inflows
    └─ Q (Maker sell-side): X consistently sends `to` Q > 80% of outflows

  P + Q each individually have `tok_in == tok_out` (drift < 0.1%) — they
  recycle tokens through X. The wash entity is the controller of P + Q
  (and possibly X if not labeled as something else).

Method B (5-step) from reference_whale_role_and_wash_methodology.md:

  Step 0 (entry): high-frequency + balanced bidirectional + tx > 500
  Step 1: atomic-pair tx ratio > 0.9
  Step 2: find single dominant counterparty on each side (>80% concentration)
  Step 3: P and Q each have drift < 0.1%
  Step 4: tx_from diversity — routed wash vs operator-controlled
  Step 5: classify

Cost: 1 batch SQL covers all entry candidates; 4 SQL per real candidate
that passes Step 0. Most CAs have 0-2 real candidates.
