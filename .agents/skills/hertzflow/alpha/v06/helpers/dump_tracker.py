"""dump_tracker.py — entity-level realized-sell ("派发"/Wyckoff distribution)
tracking, distinct from wallet-to-wallet transfers ("分发").

Why (Phase 2, 2026-05-27):

  v0.7.10.x `dumped_pct` is wallet-level outflow — it counts ANY transfer
  out (to another wallet, to a vesting contract, to an exchange) as
  "distributed". The user wants the Wyckoff sense of 派发: an entity (and
  its wallet cluster) actually SELLING — tokens reaching a CEX deposit, a
  DEX swap, or a cross-chain bridge. A wallet shuffling tokens to its own
  next address is 分发 (transfer), not 派发 (sell).

Cost design (validated 2026-05-27):

  Pulling the whole-token transfer graph (even segmented + parallel) is too
  heavy — `GROUP BY from,to` over monthly bsc_transfers partitions ran
  >350s before being killed. INSTEAD this module is purely POST-PROCESSING
  of rule_11's already-fetched graph:
    - rule_11 already pulled deployer → receivers → m6 sub-receivers and
      each dumper's `dumper_destinations` (targeted WHERE from=addr queries,
      which are fast). That graph is in memory.
    - We classify the terminal/destination nodes via Arkham (batch) into
      CEX-custody / DEX-infra / bridge = SELL terminals.
    - A "sell" = token amount flowing from a cluster wallet (or its m6
      descendants) into a sell terminal.
    - One `surf market-price` series query values every sell at its
      timestamp (in-memory binary search, no per-sell query).
  Net new on-chain cost: 0 transfer SQL + 1 price query + label batches
  (mostly reused from rule_11's enrichment). Wall-clock +20-30s.

Output (consumed by the skeleton's dump_tracking block + verdict + render).

NOTE: v0.7.12 replaced the earlier per-cluster disposal shape (clusters[] with
per-cluster sold_tokens / est_profit_usd) with a single conservation-safe
CONFIRMED-SOLD LOWER BOUND. Per-entity profit attribution was dropped on
purpose: `received_from_deployer` is a flow that double-counts on relays, so
per-entity disposal could not be attributed without over-claiming. The headline
is now the aggregate confirmed lower bound + a single estimated-proceeds figure
(`confirmed_total_tokens × robust median DEX price`; insiders are zero-cost
genesis allocations, so estimated proceeds ≈ realized profit):

    """Insider disposal ("派发") tracking — CONFIRMED-SOLD LOWER BOUND only.

    Methodology (2026-05-28 redesign, leader call — see
    reference_dump_vs_distribution_methodology §6):

    We report ONLY what the chain can prove, because that is the number a
    holder should act on (defensive posture). We deliberately DROPPED the
    "allocation − current balance" upper bound: allocation was a SUM of
    `received_from_deployer`, a FLOW that double-counts whenever the deployer
    round-trips / relays tokens (R2 cycled ~1B through 4 wallets, each logged
    ~1B → a 1013%-of-circulating, >total-supply impossibility). An upper bound
    that is routinely wrong is worse than no upper bound.

    What we report:
    * CONFIRMED-SOLD LOWER BOUND = (a) transfers from insider wallets into
      CEX-deposit addresses (deposit = sale by convention; fill is off-chain)
      + (b) insider wallets' OWN DEX swaps selling the token (token_sold=CA,
      tx_from ∈ insiders → a real buyer paid). Both are DIRECTED exits, so no
      round-trip double-count. (a)+(b) is a FLOOR: true selling is at least
      this, possibly more via routes we cannot label.
    * CURRENT INSIDER HOLDINGS (stock) = Σ current balance of the insider set
      — round-trip-immune (≤ total supply always). Includes still-locked
      vesting, so it is "% of supply under insider control", not free float.
    * PRICE = robust median DEX unit price (defeats amount_usd outliers);
      est. proceeds = confirmed_total × median.
    * Insider set = all traced rule_11 receivers EXCEPT exit infrastructure
      (cex_custody / dex_infra are destinations, not insider-held wallets).

    Args:
        rule11: raw rule_11 return (pre_launch_receivers).
