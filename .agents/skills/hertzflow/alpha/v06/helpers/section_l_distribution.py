"""section_l_distribution.py — role-based holdings distribution + lineage flowchart.

Pure aggregation. Consumes:
- top_holders (from section_f_holders)
- rule11 outputs (deployer, pre_launch_receivers, quiet_wallets,
  dumper_destinations)
- dex_pool_addr (from section_liq.discover_main_pool)

Classifies every top holder into a closed-enum role, aggregates into
holdings_distribution.role_rows + progress_bars, and pushes lineage
flowchart nodes (node_NNN) / edges via the shared EvidenceGraph.

Role enum (closed):
  DEX_POOL          — matches dex_pool_addr
  DEPLOYER          — matches deployer address
  RULE11_QUIET      — in rule11.quiet_wallets, dumped_pct = 0
  RULE11_PARTIAL    — rule11 receiver with 0 < dumped_pct < 95
  RULE11_FULL       — rule11 receiver with dumped_pct >= 95 (rare to still hold)
  OPERATOR_RELAY    — dumper-destination holding >= 1% total supply (likely
                      operator/insider rotation wallet, NOT retail fan-out)
  DUMPER_DEST       — dumper-destination holding < 1% total supply (retail fan-out)
  OTHER             — everything else (organic + retail + unclassified)

v0.6 (2026-05-24, Phase B.4)
v0.6.0-beta.3 (2026-05-24): split DUMPER_DEST into OPERATOR_RELAY +
DUMPER_DEST based on holding size. ZEST 3-sym test exposed: when 3
wallets receive 90.44% supply from a Rule 11 dumper, they're operator
relay wallets (the real holders to monitor), not "retail fan-out". The
unified DUMPER_DEST label misled the reader.

    Why: rule_11 receivers only cover m6 depth-1 wallets. Vesting
    contracts often sit 2-3 hops down (treasury → Sablier funder →
    Sablier Lockup → recipients). They land in Top 50 holders but were
    classified as "OTHER" because lockup_set didn't include them.
    FOLKS empirical: Sablier Lockup NFT held 4.22M FOLKS (27.7% of
    circulating) as "其他 (散户+未分类)" in v0.9.6.

    Cost: 1 wallet-labels-batch call (~1-2 credits / 50 addrs). Same
    helper used by rule_11 / cross_sym / flow_operators sections.

    Failure-safe: any error returns empty set → caller fallback is
    v0.9.6 behavior (m6-only lockup_set). Never regresses.
