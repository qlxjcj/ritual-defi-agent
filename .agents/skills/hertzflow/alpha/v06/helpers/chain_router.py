"""chain_router.py — v0.7.20 cross-chain SQL table router.

Background
==========

forensic_pipeline.py and every helper (rule_11, dump_tracker, wash_infra,
section_a, section_anomaly_72h, section_liq, section_tge, role_classifier,
section_wash_infra) hardcoded `agent.bsc_transfers` and `agent.bsc_dex_trades`
in their SQL strings, dating to v0.6 when the skill was BSC-only. v0.7.20
adds a chain-routing layer so the same pipeline can run against any of
surf's 7 EVM-compatible chains plus Solana.

Surf's data coverage (re-verified 2026-06-02 after v0.7.21.7 FARTCOIN
ship surfaced a coverage gap I had previously documented wrong):

  ✅ BSC          agent.bsc_transfers       / agent.bsc_dex_trades
  ✅ Ethereum    agent.ethereum_transfers  / agent.ethereum_dex_trades
  ✅ Arbitrum    agent.arbitrum_transfers  / agent.arbitrum_dex_trades
  ✅ Base        agent.base_transfers      / agent.base_dex_trades
  ✅ Polygon     agent.polygon_transfers   / agent.polygon_dex_trades
  ✅ Optimism    agent.optimism_transfers  / agent.optimism_dex_trades
  ⚠️  Solana     **NOT covered** by surf's onchain-sql (no
                 `agent.solana_*` table exists; `surf onchain-schema`
                 lists `arbitrum/base/bsc/ethereum/tempo` as the
                 SQL-supported chains as of 2026-06-02).

For Solana tokens we can still hit:
  - `surf token-holders --chain solana --address <CA> --include labels`
    (REST endpoint, returns top-N holders with Arkham labels)
  - `surf project-detail` for realtime price / vol / mcap

…but the SQL-driven detectors (rule_11 mint trace, dump_tracker
top-seller table, wash_infra_detector closed-loop SQL, flow_operator
cross-Alpha SQL, section_anomaly_72h transfer SQL, section_liq pool
SQL, section_tge LP-first-trade SQL, section_l_distribution dumper-
destination SQL, cross_sym registry SQL) all require those missing
Solana tables.

v0.7.21.8 therefore routes Solana through a HOLDER_SNAPSHOT mode:
SQL-only sections short-circuit with a `_skip_reason="surf_no_sql_solana"`
status; section_f_holders (REST), section_alloc (Alpha API), and the
monitoring-paste export still run. Pre-v0.7.21.8 those SQL sections
silently returned empty rows and the report shipped looking like a
forensic clean bill of health, which is the misleading failure mode
the user caught when FARTCOIN's report showed 0 m6 / 0 cross-sym
whales / 0 wash setups despite being a $151M MC live token.

History note: v0.7.20's "surf supports Solana SQL" line came from me
misreading a `surf onchain-sql` error message — when a Solana table
identifier was passed in the SQL parser ran its missing-`block_date`
pre-check and echoed the table name back in the error string, which I
interpreted as "table exists". A subsequent probe with a real
block_date filter returned a UNKNOWN_TABLE error explicitly listing
the supported chains (no Solana). v0.7.21.7's pipeline ran end-to-end
on FARTCOIN but every SQL detector hit the same UNKNOWN_TABLE error
and degraded to empty rows, producing the misleading "looks ok"
skeleton. v0.7.21.8 fail-loud-but-graceful on that gap.

Usage pattern
=============

`forensic_pipeline.py` calls `set_active_chain(chain_id)` immediately
after `section_a_scope` returns the scope dict (which contains the
Alpha API's `chainId`). Every downstream helper module reads the active
chain via `transfers_table()` / `dex_trades_table()` instead of hard-
coding the BSC table name.

Defaults to `bsc` if `set_active_chain` was never called, preserving
behavior for any out-of-pipeline callers that import a helper directly
(e.g. CLI smoke tests).

Thread-safety
=============

`forensic_pipeline.py` is a single-shot CLI. The active chain is set
exactly once in the main thread immediately after Section A returns the
Alpha-API `chainId`, and is read by all downstream helpers — including
helpers that fan out via `ThreadPoolExecutor` inside `wash_infra_detector`
/ `dump_tracker` / `rule_11_backward_trace`.

We deliberately use a **plain module-level string** rather than
`ContextVar` or `threading.local`. Empirical test (verified during
v0.7.20 development): a `ContextVar` with a `default=` value is NOT
inherited by `ThreadPoolExecutor` workers — they see the default, not
the value set in the main thread. That would silently route SQL in
parallel sections to BSC even when the main thread set Base, exactly
the v0.7.19.x mis-routing bug we're fixing. `threading.local` has the
same problem (workers get a fresh local).

Module-level string works because Python's GIL gives every thread the
same view of module globals. The "global mutable codex flag" cost is
worth paying here — the alternative is a silent cross-thread routing
bug.

Use the `chain_lock()` context manager (or `set_active_chain` + explicit
reset in tests) when you need to temporarily route SQL to a different
chain.
