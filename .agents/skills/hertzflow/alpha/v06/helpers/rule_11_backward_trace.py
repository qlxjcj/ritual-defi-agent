"""rule_11_backward_trace.py — Rule 11 deployment backward trace (v0.6).

v0.6 upgrade from v0.5.9:
1. Returns provenance IDs (evt_NNN, m6_NNN) into a passed-in EvidenceGraph,
   not raw dicts. Caller (forensic_pipeline.py) gets back evidence IDs to
   embed into the report skeleton.
2. Returns `waves_proposal` — fully-formed `anomaly.waves[]` structure
   ready to drop into `report_data_skeleton.json`. This closes the
   "Rule 11 narrative gap" codex audit finding (v0.5.9 produced m6.rows
   but did not derive the wave structure; LLMs forgot to write waves
   themselves).

## 4-step backward trace

1. Find mint event — wide-floor aggregate over `from = 0x0` mints (v0.7.13).
   GROUP BY recipient picks the largest cumulative 0x0 recipient as the
   de-facto deployer; works for a single genesis mint AND multi-recipient
   emission. A wide MINT_LOOKBACK_DAYS floor catches deploy→listing gaps the
   180d default misses (XPIN: 0x0 genesis 2025-07-25, listed 2026-01-27 =
   ~186d → mint fell 6 days outside the old 180d floor → whole trace lost).
   No 0x0 mint in the window → `_status='no_deployer_anchor'` graceful
   partial (holder snapshot, no fabricated origin), never a hard abort.
2. Trace deployer outflows in `[trace_floor, alpha_listing_date]`
   (trace_floor = min(180d floor, mint day) so genesis-era dispersal is kept)
3. Per receiver: received + balance → dumped_pct
4. Top dumpers: trace destination addresses

    Rationale: 80-90% of LAB-class tokens have mint within 90d of listing.
    The fast-path saves ~9 chunks per run on those, dropping step1_mint
    cost from ~10× single SQL latency to ~1×. Tokens with mint outside
    the fast window (XPIN-style 186d, mature tokens listed many months
    after deploy) fall back to the full lookback automatically — no
    correctness loss.

    codex audit H1 fix: distinguishes 3 outcomes via the third tuple element
    `lookup_ok`:
    - rows + ok=True: clean hit, downstream proceeds.
    - [] + ok=True: clean miss (queries ran, no 0x0 mint exists in window) —
      downstream degrades to no-anchor partial (existing graceful path).
    - [] + ok=False: chunks errored, we don't actually know — caller MUST
      surface this as a transient failure, NOT misclassify as no-anchor.

    codex audit M2 fix: when fast-path errors on ALL fast chunks, do NOT
    waste time on the fallback (it will also error if surf is broken).
    Return ok=False immediately so the caller fails loud instead of
    paying for a doubled SQL surface.

        fast_days_after: window size after listing (default 7) — covers
