"""push_airdrop_detector.py — identify retail "push" airdrop recipients
in the pre-launch deployer-outflow window so dump_tracker does not
mis-classify them as insiders.

# Why this exists (v0.8.1)

`pre_launch_receivers` is everyone who received tokens directly from the
deployer between `trace_floor` and `alpha_listing_date`. That set is the
basis for the "insider" universe used to compute `confirmed_total_tokens`
(a)+(b) — the "确认毛卖出" metric.

Failure case: if the project did a `disperse`-style push airdrop to N
retail wallets (`deployer → batch_transfer → 5,000 EOAs`) before listing,
every one of those EOAs lands in `pre_launch_receivers` and their post-
listing sells inflate the "insider 真实变现" number. Pull / Merkle-claim
airdrops do NOT trigger this — retail wallets receive from the claim
contract, not the deployer, so they never enter `pre_launch_receivers`.

# Heuristic

A pre-launch deployer outflow tx is classified as a push-airdrop
distribution iff:

  COUNT(DISTINCT to_addr) within one tx_hash  >=  PUSH_MIN_RECIPIENTS

Default threshold = 50. Rationale:
  - VC / team allocation rounds use Gnosis Safe multi-call or hand-
    submitted batches, typically <= 20 recipients per tx (often 1).
  - Retail airdrop disperse libraries (disperse.app, gas-optimized
    multi-send) emit transactions with 50-1000 recipients.
  - 50 is conservative: it accepts a few false negatives (a VC round
    with 50+ allocations in one tx is unusual but possible) in
    exchange for near-zero false positives on the retail side.

# Output

Every recipient address appearing in any tx that crosses the threshold
is labeled `is_push_airdrop_recipient`. Those addresses are excluded
from `insider_addrs` (so their CEX deposits / DEX swaps no longer
inflate the (a)+(b) confirmed-sellout floor).

Conservative semantics:
  - We exclude from the INSIDER set, not from the holdings tree. The
    tokens are still tracked for supply accounting; we just no longer
    attribute their post-launch sells to insider exit.
  - This is one-way: a wallet flagged via this detector stays flagged
    even if it also received a separate "VC-shaped" allocation. The
    rare false positive of misclassifying a hybrid wallet is preferred
    over the systemic false positive of treating every airdrop recipient
    as an insider.

Cost: 1 surf transfers query per CA, time-bounded to the rule_11 window
(deployer outflows are sparse so the GROUP BY is cheap).
