"""v0.7.23.1: Funding source attribution for high-value addresses.

Reverse approach to "矿币 / bridge / airdrop distribution modelling".

Standard rule_11 (deployer → m6 → m4) assumes a single deployer is the
distribution authority. Tokens like Humanity Protocol, Aethir-class
mining tokens, Polyhedra-class bridge tokens, and vesting-airdrop
tokens violate this — the deployer is a placeholder; real distribution
flows via bridge mint contracts, vesting contracts, or airdrop reward
contracts. Forward-decoding the distribution mechanism is surf-load-
intensive (cluster hub detection across thousands of mining receivers)
and depends on an unstable threshold (n_senders ≥ 10 etc.).

Reverse approach instead: take the high-value addresses surfaced by
existing detectors (wash_infra P/Q, flow_operators op_addrs, rule_11
m6 receivers, dump_tracker insider_addrs, top_holders top-N) and ask
"where did each addr's token come from": mint vs DEX buy vs CEX
withdraw vs P2P transfer. A wallet with 87% mint origin + heavy DEX
dump activity is operator-mined-then-dumped; 92% DEX buy + heavy dump
is normal retail PnL-taker. The classification answers the user's
real question ("是不是庄家在出货") without decoding the mining
mechanism.

One batch SQL (group by addr, source) covers up to ~200 addresses
within surf's 30s budget.

# v0.7.23.2: mining-fed wallet outflow detector
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# attribute_funding() above tells us which high-value addresses received their
# tokens via mint (= are operators of bridge / mining / vesting contracts).
# v0.7.23.1 stopped there — the report flagged mining-fed wallets but didn't
# tell retail what they DID with the tokens. Now we follow up: for each
# mining-fed address, query its 365d DEX swap-sells (token_sold = ca,
# tx_from = addr) and its outgoing transfer destinations. That tells the
# reader "operator X received Y tokens from mint, dumped Z on DEX for $USD,
# routed W to destinations D1/D2/D3". This is the data dump_tracker (a)(b)
# would have surfaced if rule_11's m6 had been populated; here we recover it
# from the funding-attribution result instead, fixing the false-zero on
# mining-token forensic runs.

# v0.7.24a: discover mint authorities — top from-0x0 minters by amount in
# 365d window. Mint authorities are bridge/staking/airdrop contracts that
# physically issue new supply on-chain. They are NOT necessarily in the
# high_value_addrs set that attribute_funding scans (they only receive 0x0
# transfers, not P2P), so the v0.7.23.x mining_fed_outflows path misses
# them. Specifically: 0x6aa22cb8 (H bridge contract) minted 132.5B H over
# 30d and self-DEX-dumped 19.8B (≈ $3M) — never surfaced before.

# materialization is small enough that ClickHouse handles it inside 30s.

#     > max. Safe to pre-filter at SQL. Without this, wash bots with huge
#     per-chunk amt_in fill the LIMIT and push real operators out.)

    Detect operator wallets that have ingested a large quantity of tokens
    over the 365d window but cleared out (balance ≈ 0), via many txs. The
    sss_crypto Twitter forensic thread on H called out exactly this pattern:
    0x47a6e4e1 received 30.6M, sent 30.5M (residual 0.09M), 79,048 txs over
    365d. These operators are deliberately invisible to:
      - rule_11 (deployer placeholder model)
      - wash_infra (P→X→Q async, not atomic)
      - flow_operators (60d window misses earlier dump)
      - mining_fed (receive via p2p from authorities, not directly from 0x0)
      - mint_authority (they're receivers, not 0x0-issuers)
      - top_holders (balance ≈ 0 keeps them off the table)

    Default thresholds tuned to H/sss_crypto cohort:
      - min_throughput=1M: filters small dust; 0x47a6e4e1 has 30.6M
      - max_balance_frac=0.05: balance within 5% of throughput counts as
        "cleared out"; 0x47a6e4e1 has 92k residual on 30.6M = 0.3%
